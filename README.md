# nft-intro-video
a video project for the Untitled NFT Hackathon

## The Result
The final version of the video can be found on YouTube:
https://youtu.be/uqGJMU2FcTQ

Upon request I can also send you the original video file!

## Request for Changes
I can still make minor changes to the video. Just pop me an email ;)

Depending on where it is to be shown it might make sense to shorten the video.
I like the current length but I'm also a YouTuber, so I'm used to long videos, but it might not work so well on other plattforms.


## Workload 
I've spent a total of 8h on this project.  
Scripting: 2h  
Filming: 2h  
Editing: 4h

## Publication
Unless I'm instucted otherwise, I will publish the video on my YouTube channel after the challenge ended.
